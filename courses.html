                        <p style="text-align: justify;">For each of you, your yoga practice is going to look different. I prefer an everyday, 15-minute practice of a variety of different types of sequences but you may choose just to do 3 sessions a week or to double up every day. The timing is also going to be unique to your personal scheduling and commitments. I like to warm up for runs with Mobility-style sequences, cool down with Flexibility and Recovery sessions and train Core Strength on days when I am not running. But I encourage you to experiment with what works for you. You can always drop me a message if you have any questions. </p>

                        <h5>WHY THIS COURSE?</h5>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Here is a breakdown of why upper body flexibility is so crucial for cyclists. </p>
                        <h6>1. Aerodynamic Positioning</h6>
                        <li>Aerodynamic Position: This position involves having the torso low and the arms extended forward, which places significant strain on the neck and shoulders.</li>
                        <li>Head Position: Maintaining a low, forward head position helps reduce drag, but this requires a flexible neck to keep the head up and eyes forward without excessive strain.</li> <br>
                        <h6>2. Comfort and Endurance</h6>
                        <li>Prolonged Effort: Sustaining the aerodynamic position for such durations demands good flexibility to avoid discomfort and pain.</li> 
                        <li>Muscle Fatigue: Inflexible neck and shoulders can lead to muscle fatigue, causing discomfort that distracts from performance and can affect endurance and power output.</li> <br>
                        <h6>3. Injury Prevention</h6>
                        <li>Strain and Tension: Tight or inflexible muscles are more prone to strain. Cyclists with poor flexibility in the neck and shoulders are at a higher risk of overuse injuries.</li> 
                        <li>Balance and Stability: Good flexibility contributes to better stability and control, which can prevent accidents and injuries, especially when adjusting positions or navigating turns.</li>
                        <h6>4. Power Transfer</h6>
                        <li>Upper Body Relaxation: Flexible neck and shoulders allow the upper body to remain relaxed, minimizing unnecessary movements and maximizing power transfer to the pedals.</li> 
                        <li>Efficient Breathing: Flexibility aids in maintaining an open chest and proper breathing mechanics, which is essential for oxygen delivery during high-intensity efforts.</li>

                        <h5>BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR WEIGHTLIFTERS</h5>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">“To all you muscle-bound guys pumping iron—get down on the mat and start stretching.” Dr. Nicholas DiNubile. <br>
                        Weight-lifting, like all sports, can establish muscular imbalances in the body that lead to restrictions in mobility and even injury over time. This is only exacerbated if you focus on isolated exercises, such as bicep curls, calf raises and triceps kickbacks that develop muscles unevenly. <br>
                        Regular practice of the Yoga For Weightlifters program can help to prevent injuries and imbalances in the following ways:</p>
                        <li>Release tension in tight muscles</li>
                        <li>Strengthen smaller stabiliser muscles that can be neglected in weightlifting</li>
                        <li>Increase mobility in stiff joints</li>
                        <li>Improve body (muscle activation) awareness</li>
                        <li>Accelerate recovery</li>
                        <li>Reduce your risk of injury</li>
                        <li>Relieve stress</li>
                        <li>Improve your focus and concentration</li>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">These improvements, especially to your mobility and flexibility, will not only reduce your risk of pain and injury but also accelerate your performance and increase your gains.</p>

                        <h5>COMMON ISSUES FOR HIKERS</h5>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Hikers require excellent strength, balance and stamina and yoga can help to train all three.</p>
                        <li>Strength—The muscles you need to prepare for a hike are also those you need to take the time to stretch out after. Primarily, the:</li>
                        <li>Quads, glutes, hamstrings and calves.</li>
                        <li>Neck, core, upper and lower back.</li>
                        <li>Balance—Similarly with balance, hikers need good stability in the ankles, knees, hips and core and these are the areas we also need to pay attention to after your hike. </li>
                        <li>Stamina—In yoga, hikers can learn to improve stamina by practicing effective nasal breathing and building muscular endurance in the muscles. We do this by holding poses for several breaths and repeating this week after week.</li>
                        <h5>COURSE STRUCTURE</h5>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">In this course, I have divided the videos into three sections:</p>
                        <li>Prepare—These videos are designed to engage and activate key muscles groups, either immediately pre-hike or in preparation for a hiking trip.</li>
                        <li>Restore—You can practice these sequences directly after you come back from your hike to release tension in the muscles that you have been working hard.</li>
                        <li>Rejuvenate—These routines are designed to relax your body and mind in the evening so that you get the best sleep possible and always feel rejuvenated.</li>

              <p style="text-align: justify;" class="card-text">In yin yoga, instead of flowing from one pose to the next, we focus on just a few postures, holding each of them for a minimum of 10 breaths. In this style, time, not intensity, is the active ingredient. We work alongside gravity to release deeply-held tension, exerting as little muscular effort as possible and prioritising stillness and receptivity over movement and strength.All styles of yoga improve your overall sense of wellbeing.

              <p style="text-align: justify;" class="card-text">This 28-day course is designed as a Strength and Conditioning program that trains strength, mobility, flexibility and balance. It is for the most hardcore amongst you!I travel a fair amount. In the last 4 months, I have spent time in Mexico, London, France, Brussels, Lisbon and Greece. Unfortunately, this means that I haven’t been able to stick to my Altamirano Systems training program every day as I normally would.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;" class="card-text">This 30-day course is designed to improve your functional hamstring flexibility so that you can get into any position that your sport demands and achieve your best times yet. By the end of the month, you’ll be more supple, better able to generate power at your end ranges of motion and free from related aches and pains. You should also feel far more graceful in your yoga practice!

              <p style="text-align: justify;" class="card-text">It seems that everyone in my life has less than stellar shoulder range of motion. My boxing coach, ex-rugby-playing best friend, Greg Minnaar—world champion mountain biker after crashing in Snowshoe last month, my gardening mother and even me in the past as an over-zealous, younger yogi.The shoulder is one of our most versatile joints. It can flex, extend, abduct, adduct, and rotate internally and externally.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;" class="card-text">When you get into a rhythm of practicing the videos in this course consistently, you will find that you can get into all the body positions that you need to for your sport, fast, with precision and pain-free.In this course, we cycle through Recovery, Flexibility, Mobility, Strength and Balance videos that range in difficulty from easy through to advanced. And I have set the course to “linear” so that you can jump around and choose the session that is most appropriate for you each day.

              <h3 class="card-title">RELEASE TIGHT GLUTES</h3> <br>
              <p style="text-align: justify;" class="card-text">This course is designed to release tension in tight glutes so that you stay supple and pain-free whatever your training and everyday movement habits.I have chosen 12 videos that focus on releasing tension in tight hips, specifically the glutes. My recommendation is that you practice 3 per week for 4 weeks. If you’re a one-a-day or more kind of athlete, you could take this course alongside another that you are working through but equally you can follow this program on its own.</p>
